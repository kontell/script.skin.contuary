"""Build a Kodi-installable zip of the addon.

Packages the working tree into ``<outdir>/<id>-<version>.zip`` with every file
nested under a top-level ``<id>/`` directory, exactly as Kodi's "Install from
zip file" expects, and as the repository's updater expects of a release asset.
Development-only files are left out -- the same set ``tools/dev-install.sh``
keeps out of the installed tree -- so the zip carries only what the addon needs
at runtime. The id and version come straight from ``addon.xml``.

Kept deliberately in step with plugin.video.kofin's tools/build.py: the Kontell
addons are released through one repository and a difference between their zips
is a difference nobody would look for.

Usage: build.py [OUTDIR]      (default OUTDIR: ./dist)
